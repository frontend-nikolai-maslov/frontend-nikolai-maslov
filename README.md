Seasoned Frontend Developer with a solid 6-year track record in international team environments. Expert in Vue & Nuxt, React & Next frameworks, adept in state management using Vuex and Redux, and versatile in adapting to additional frameworks.

## BEYOND WORK

Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, running, and spending time outdoors — staying active helps me recharge and stay focused. I love going on hiking trips with my family and our dog, combining nature, movement, and quality time together. I also play the guitar as a creative outlet. I value continuous learning, a positive attitude, and responsibility in everything I do.
